- **Format Size Adjustment:** You can choose whether to adjust the format size of your SD card or not. If you enable this option, the tool will try to restore your SD card to its original capacity by deleting any hidden partitions or unallocated space. This option is useful if your SD card has been formatted by another device that may have reduced its capacity.
- **Volume Label:** You can enter a name for your formatted SD card up to 11 characters long.

After choosing your formatting options, click on "OK" to return to the main window.

The final step is to format your SD card by clicking on the "Format" button at the bottom of the window. A confirmation message will appear asking you if you are sure you want to format your SD card. Click on "Yes" to proceed. The tool will then start formatting your SD card and show you a progress bar. Once the formatting is complete, a message will appear telling you that your SD card has been formatted successfully. Click on "OK" to close the message and exit the tool.
