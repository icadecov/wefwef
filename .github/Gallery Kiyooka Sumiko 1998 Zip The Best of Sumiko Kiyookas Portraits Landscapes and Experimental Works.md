Gallery Kiyooka Sumiko is a collection of photographs by Sumiko Kiyooka, a Japanese photographer who was born in 1921 and died in 1991. Kiyooka was known for her portraits of children, women, and landscapes, as well as her experimental works using collage, montage, and solarization. She was also a pioneer of color photography in Japan, and one of the first female photographers to gain recognition in the male-dominated field.
 
The gallery features some of her most iconic images, such as *Girl with a Flower*, *Woman with a Hat*, and *Cherry Blossoms*, as well as some of her lesser-known works, such as *Self-Portrait*, *Abstract Composition*, and *Cityscape*. The gallery also includes a biography of Kiyooka, a timeline of her career, and a commentary by a curator who explains the significance and context of her photographs.

Kiyooka was born in Tokyo in 1921, and grew up in a wealthy and cultured family. She was interested in art and literature from a young age, and studied painting at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts.

She continued to exhibit her works in Japan and abroad, and became one of the most influential photographers of her generation. She also taught photography at several universities and colleges, and mentored many young photographers.

She often experimented with different methods and materials, such as printing on silk or glass, or using multiple exposures or filters. She also explored various themes and subjects, such as nature, urban life, childhood, femininity, and spirituality. She aimed to express her emotions and impressions through her images, rather than to document reality.

Kiyooka's photography was influenced by both Western and Eastern art and culture. She admired the works of European photographers such as Henri Cartier-Bresson, Man Ray, and BrassaÃ¯, and incorporated elements of surrealism, expressionism, and modernism into her own works. She also drew inspiration from Japanese aesthetics and traditions, such as haiku, Zen Buddhism, and Noh theater. She blended these influences in a unique and creative way, creating a distinctive photographic language.
 
Kiyooka's photography was also a reflection of her personal life and experiences. She faced many challenges and hardships throughout her life, such as the loss of her parents, the death of her husband, the illness of her son, and the social discrimination against women. She used photography as a way of coping with these difficulties, and as a means of expressing her feelings and thoughts. She also used photography as a way of celebrating life and finding joy in the simple things.
 
Kiyooka died in 1991 at the age of 70. She left behind a rich and diverse body of work that spans over four decades. Her photographs are widely recognized as masterpieces of Japanese photography, and have been exhibited and collected by many museums and galleries around the world. Her photographs are also admired by many people who appreciate her artistic vision and humanistic spirit.
