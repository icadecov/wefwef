Accelrys Discovery Studio 3.5 is a suite of software tools for simulating small molecule and macromolecule systems. It is developed and distributed by Dassault Systemes BIOVIA (formerly Accelrys) [^6^]. Discovery Studio 3.5 can help you gain insight into the potential implications of your molecule's structure by using various methods such as molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics, quantum mechanics, ligand design, pharmacophore modeling, structure-based design, macromolecule design and validation, QSAR, ADME and predictive toxicity [^6^] [^7^].

In this article, we will show you how to use Discovery Studio 3.5 for some common tasks such as visualizing molecular structures, performing docking simulations, creating pharmacophore models and generating molecular libraries. We will also provide some tips and tricks to optimize your workflow and results.
 
## Visualizing Molecular Structures
 
Discovery Studio 3.5 provides a powerful and user-friendly interface for visualizing and manipulating molecular structures. You can import structures from various file formats such as PDB, SDF, MOL2, etc. or create them from scratch using the sketcher tool. You can also access a large database of structures from the Discovery Studio Visualizer, which is a free software tool that can be downloaded from the developer's website [^2^].
 
Once you have loaded a structure, you can use the toolbar and menu options to change its display mode, color scheme, atom labels, bonds style, surface representation, etc. You can also use the mouse to rotate, zoom and translate the structure in 3D space. You can select atoms, residues, chains or entire molecules using the selection tool or by clicking on them directly. You can also edit the structure by adding or deleting atoms or bonds, changing atom types or charges, modifying bond orders or angles, etc.
 
Discovery Studio 3.5 also allows you to visualize various properties of your structure such as electrostatic potential, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonds, molecular orbitals, etc. You can also calculate various parameters such as molecular weight, logP, logD, pKa, etc. using the property calculator tool.
 
## Performing Docking Simulations
 
Docking is a computational method that predicts the preferred orientation of one molecule (ligand) to another (receptor) when they are bound together. Docking can help you identify potential binding sites and interactions between molecules, as well as rank different ligands based on their binding affinity or score.
 
Discovery Studio 3.5 offers several docking methods such as CDOCKER [^1^], LigandFit , GOLD , Glide , etc. Each method has its own advantages and limitations depending on the type and complexity of your system. You can choose the most suitable method for your problem by consulting the documentation or tutorials provided by Discovery Studio 3.5.
 
To perform a docking simulation, you need to prepare your receptor and ligand structures first. You can use the protein preparation wizard to clean up your receptor structure by removing water molecules, adding missing atoms or residues, optimizing hydrogen bonds, assigning charges and protonation states, etc. You can also use the ligand preparation wizard to clean up your ligand structure by removing salts or solvents, adding hydrogens, assigning charges and tautomers, etc.

Next, you need to define the docking parameters such as the binding site location and size, the scoring function and algorithm, the number of poses to generate and retain, etc. You can use the default settings or customize them according to your needs. You can also use the docking protocol editor to create your own docking protocol with multiple steps and options.
 
Finally, you need to run the docking simulation and analyze the results. You can view the docked poses in 3D along with their scores and interactions with the receptor. You can also compare different poses or methods using various tools such as cluster analysis, RMSD calculation, pose filtering and sorting, etc.
